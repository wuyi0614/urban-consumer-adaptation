### TODOs

**Preparing**

- [x] drafting research proposal using demo data

**Data streaming**

- [x] develop the taxonomy of adaptative goods for consumers - create & update `taxonomy.json`

- [x] identify hazardous events and selected regions/periods - create & update `event.json`

**Coding**

- [x] diff-in-diff stata do-file for boosting (use `.py` scripts at experimental stage)

- [x] parallel trend validation with python

- [ ] SQL-based data extraction script (*pending for aliyun*)
